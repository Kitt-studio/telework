## My awesome project for collecting statistics ðŸ“ˆ

Statistics of web platforms used by teachers in quarantine as of 04/12/2020
at a certain moment, when my university was quarantined and I was sitting at home, I wondered what kind of web platforms teachers use in our area / region.
I set up a google form mailing list and saved everything in table.csv
This is how this project actually appeared, thank you very much for your attention.
